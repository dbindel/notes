# Notebooks

This is a place to collect miscellaneous notes, bookmarks, etc.  I am
sure the structure will change over time.  The current layout of the
content folders is:

 - `doc`: general document sources
 - `bib`: BibTeX file and annotated bibliography sources
 - `src`: Source files for demo codes
 - `yml`: YAML data files for bookmarks and the like
 - `blog`: Date-organized blog-style content
 - `scan`: Scans of handwritten notes (kept in git annex)

In addition, we have the generating infrastructure:

 - `README.md`: This file
 - `Makefile`: Build file
 - `pdf`: PDF files (generally built from `src`)
 - `web`: build-out for web page linked from my home page
 - `util`: utilities for build and upload
